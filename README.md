# NodeMcu temperature sensor
Simple MQTT temperature sensor, developed for NodeMcu platform.

Application runs on custom made NodeMcu firmware, which can be generated
[here] (https://nodemcu-build.com/). MQTT and DS18B20 modules need to be added
for proper working.

More features are likely to be added later.
